Hey !!!
This is a small project idea implemented along with a few of my friends where we explore the world of encryption , decryption and cyber security!!
this project marks our understanding of AES256 , BASE 64 and python encryption protocols for hashing and securing a password 
A simple command line based password manager that has a master password (to be set by the user) and customization options such as Creation, Deletion, Viewing the current password, Editing the current password, Generation of password with the help of protocols, and various other options such as vault,,etc 
This isnt all my doing and was achieved with the help of my teamates 
This is also referenced from certain other password manager to great a gui friendly password manager.
